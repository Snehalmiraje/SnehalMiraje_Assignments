                To understand the basics of how CSS works, you must first understand a little 
                about modern HTML. Web developers lay out pages according to the "box model."
                A Web page is a series of boxes, each containing a discrete element. 
                These boxes are nested, one inside another.
                For example, a page's header is a box, and it contains several smaller boxes 
                comprising all the elements that make up a header: logo, navigation, social 
                media buttons, shopping cart buttons, etc. Using CSS, a developer assigns 
                styles to the "header" box. In this example, let's assume that the developer
                makes the text inside the header purple, Arial font and fifteen points high.
            </p>
        
            <div class="container"></div>
            
            <p class="b">

                The Updated version of HTML is HTML5.HTML5 is the combination of some new
                technologies, like HTML, XHTML and which may be the best way to learn web 
                design in a more effective way. XHTML is also an option, but its rules are 
                stricter. What websites are available on the WWW (World Wide Web) are 
                primarily designed using HTML as the main language. HTML is easy to learn
                compared to other languages.
